Revision history for Class-BuildMethods

0.22    2006-12-12
        - Removed the references to Scalar::Util::refaddr from the tests :/
        - Fixed bug where instance data might accidentally retain its data
          between different instances.  Reported by Collin Winter.

0.21    2006-12-2
        - Implemented Scalar::Util::refaddr internally because ActiveState's
          build process only provides Scalar::Util 1.07 and this version does
          not provide this function.

0.20    2006-11-15
        - Added support for class data.
        - Fixed bug whereby default data could not have a false value.

0.12    2006-10-25
        - No functional changes.
        - Listed Scalar::Util as a prereq because refaddr() wasn't added until
          1.0701
        - Added t/10-basic.t to MANIFEST.  Oops :(
